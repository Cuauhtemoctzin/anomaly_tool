# anomaly_tool
 This dashboard benchmarks time series in a multivariate set by assigning an anomaly score using a nearest-neighbor approach. In brief, an anomalous observation will have large distances compared with the rest of the observations, particularly with its nearest neighbors. The anomaly score is the sum of the distances of an observation with its nearest neighbors. We extended this concept to time series by exploring different distances between time series.
